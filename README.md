# DecisionTreeClassifier
This project implements a basic decision tree classifier from scratch in Python. The classifier can be used for classification tasks and is built with a recursive tree-building mechanism. It utilizes the Gini index for determining splits and the information gain criterion to build the tree.

# Features
Decision Tree Classification: Build and train a decision tree to classify data based on features.
Gini Index: Utilizes the Gini impurity measure for splitting nodes.
Information Gain: Uses information gain to select the best splits at each node.
Recursive Tree Building: Recursively splits the data and builds a tree structure.
Predict Function: Given a set of features, the classifier can predict the class.
